        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> Shap-Explorer is a design tool which applies text-to-3D to design. This interface uses Shap-E, a generatve models developed by OpenAI, to give designer more manipulation chance in using Generative AI for 3D assets creation.</p>

        <p>	The methodology of operations research and has been adapted into the design strategy of this project. By abstracting the calculation parts such as digital modeling and kinematics and combing them with the form finding process, this methodolgy allows us elaborate our design's personality instead of the universality.</p>
