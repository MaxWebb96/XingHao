        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technologies are increasingly employed by artists for
            their capability to rapidly generate intricate designs. While text-to-image (T2I) applications have
            been explored in art creation with constructive outcomes, the integration of text-to-3D (T23D)
            methodologies remains underexplored, primarily due to the knowledge gap between users and
            tool-makers. Developers aim to refine models for speed and accuracy, yet artists lack a steerable
            front-end tool to guide the 3D generation.</p>
        <p> To bridge this gap, this research introduces Shap-Explorer, a tool that streamlines the use of
            T23D, enabling users to iteratively modify the output models through mesh generator and
            control the generation through process controller and text deformer. Through a preliminary user
            study, this research examines the affordance of T23D and the impact of enhanced interactions on
            the generative system, such as providing design alternatives.

        <p>Insights include, for example, how users can iteratively refine and adjust the generated 3D
            models to align with their creative vision into the manipulation capabilities of generative AI tools
            in the design workflow, offering a step forward in the interactive creation of 3D art.</p>
