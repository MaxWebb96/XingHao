        <h1 class="major">3D Printing Chair: MIX</h2>
        <h4> 2019 / Digital Fabrication</h4>
        <h4> Individual work</h4>
        
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> Mix is a high performance chair which
            attempts to make full use of two robotics
            addictive manufacture methods -- Fused
            Deposition Modeling(FDM) and spatial 3D
            printing (Another kind of fused modeling
            method that can achieve partly selfsupporting).
            Both of them use PLA objects, a
            widely used degradable plastic, as material
            and the same printing effector whose operating
            temperature reaches 500 degrees Celsius. By
            designing a mix printing path , a specific
            fabrication strategy has been added into this
            process.</p>

        <p>
            Starting with the research on the structure
of elytra , an organ of insect to fly, this
project tries to explore the structural
potential of 3D printing and the materiality
of PLA. The challenge of making this chair is
that these two printing methods share robot
and material while their fabrication demands
varies widely. Therefore, it is the core
of this project how to a design printable,
ergonomic and energy saving printing path.
